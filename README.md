# Auto Categorizing Grocery List
Grocery list application that uses a Naive Bayes classification algorithm to automatically categorize items into grocery aisles. When you're ready to shop, toggle to view mode and see grocery items in an organized list by aisle. 

## Tech Stack
Built on Astro, using Vue for reactive components. Auth is managed via BetterAuth. AstroDB and Astro Actions for managing the database. 

## Naive Bayes Classifier
I used this project as an opportunity to learn more about classification algorithms and machine learning. I built the classifier by hand, but used Gemini for guidance along the way. I instructed the model to treat me as pupil, avoid giving the answer and to ask me questions to reinforce my understanding. 

Through this exercise, I learned about probabilities, logarithmic identities, laplace smoothing and model training.
